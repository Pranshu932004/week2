                <p> Automat is time saving, easy access, data managing, easy to
                    operate and it is one-time investment. It will reduce the
                    mistakes done at the hotel which is ultimately a loss for
                    restaurant.
                   In this project we have used PHP in backend and the data
                    entered by the user is stored in the database of 000webhost
                    and afterwards it will retrieved at manager site.
                    I learned how to connect the public database to our website
                    and make a working website.</p>

                    management quiet easy.
                    In this project we have used the PHP language to make the
                    connection between frontend and server
                    We learned that how to use the PHP language in connecting
                    database with the HTML form and store the data in the
                    database which is entered by the user.</p>
